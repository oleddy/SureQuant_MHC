# SureQuant MHC
This repository contains scripts for SureQuant mass spec method building for analysis of peptides presented on MHCs, and for analyzing data generated by these methods for absolute and relative quantification. 

##Installation

Run the following to download the code: 
  git clone https://github.com/oleddy/SureQuant_MHC.git

Install all dependencies by running
  pip install -r requirements.txt

Code was tested with Python 3.11.3 on macOS 12.0.1

##Method Building

To generate the tables you will need to build your instrument method, start with a report exported from Skyline containing data from a survey run including only the stable isotope labeled (SIL) trigger peptides for your SureQuant panel. An example can be found in method_building/example_inputs.

The generate_method_tables.py script takes four arguments:


##Relative Quantification

##Absolute Quantification
