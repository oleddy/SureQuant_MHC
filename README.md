# SureQuant MHC
This repository contains scripts for SureQuant mass spec method building for analysis of peptides presented on MHCs, and for analyzing data generated by these methods for absolute and relative quantification. 

## Installation

Run the following in the command line to download the code: 
~~~
git clone https://github.com/oleddy/SureQuant_MHC.git
~~~

Install all dependencies as follows:
~~~
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

Code was tested with Python 3.11.3 on macOS 12.0.1

## Method Building

To generate the tables you will need to build your instrument method, start with a report exported from Skyline containing data from a survey run including only the stable isotope labeled (SIL) trigger peptides for your SureQuant panel. An example can be found in method_building/example_inputs.

The generate_method_tables.py script takes the following arguments:
|Flag |Definition|Required? (Y/N)|
|:--- |:--- |:---|
|-i|The path to the input data (a Survey_Run_Results report exported from Skyline)|Y|
|-o|The path to a directory where the output should be generated|Y|
|-l|A comma-spearated list of the SIL label mass offsets (in Daltons) that occur among your set of targets (e.g., "-l 6,7")|Y|
|-c|A comma-separated list of the charge states that occur among your set of targets (e.g., "-c 2,3"). Default value is "2,3".|N|
|-n|The number of fragment ions in each pseudospectrum. Must be an integer, not greater than the number of fragment ions per peptide in your spectral library. Default value is 6.|N|
